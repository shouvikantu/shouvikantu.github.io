      <h1>AI and Accessibility</h1> 
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has important effects on accessibility, particularly for neurodivergent people. Autism and ADHD are two conditions that fall under the category of neurodivergent, which describes the natural variation in how people's brains are wired. People who are neurodivergent frequently find it difficult to keep up with their neurotypical peers in the classroom or at work, but AI is facilitating their access to the resources they require to succeed.
        iTherapy InnerVoice is one illustration of how AI is affecting access to education. With the aid of artificial intelligence, this program aims to improve the connections between language and objects for neurodiverse students. The software instantaneously describes or labels an object while it is being viewed by the phone's camera. Additionally, AI can explain ideas and bodily movements using animated gifs, which helps students make the connection between what they hear and what they see. A speech-to-speech feature in the app's AI-powered 3D avatar feature enables users to make an exact replica of themselves and have it speak. This is especially helpful for non-verbal kids or people with speech impairments because it enables them to create a realistic avatar of themselves speaking that they can imitate. Additionally, InnerVoice has a prompt feature that enables instructors to direct students toward the right response and reduce frustration in the classroom while they are engaged in educational activities.
        AI increases neurodiverse people's employment opportunities as well as their access to education. Numerous businesses have started to create algorithms for jobs like pattern recognition that call for software developers with specialized knowledge in engineering, science, data analysis, pattern recognition, and data processing. Many neurodivergent people excel in these fields, and businesses have discovered that they outperform their neurotypical counterparts. Companies have recently learned that neurodiverse workers' propensity for repetitive tasks can increase their efficiency and loyalty, making them excellent employees.
        The workplace has improved as a result of the new incentive to hire neurodivergent workers, creating a more welcoming environment for them and creating new opportunities. In order to lessen outside distractions for their neurodivergent employees, more and more businesses are providing accommodations like private offices. EY has gone above and beyond to make it easier for its new hires to integrate because it is actively seeking out neurodiverse talent. Managers modified their speech by cutting out idioms and other abstract language in order to more clearly explain concepts and instructions. This not only assisted neurodivergent workers in adjusting to the workplace, according to EY, but it also forced their managers to use more precise language in order to avoid confusing employees, which helped managers become more effective managers.
        Despite the need and desire for neurodiversity in the workplace, conventional hiring practices frequently devalue neurodivergent people. As a result, lots of businesses have developed initiatives devoted to finding and hiring talent with neurodevelopmental skills. For instance, the EY Neurodiversity Center of Excellence (CoE) in Philadelphia is dedicated to hiring people with neurodiversity, developing their skills, and comprehending how neurodiversity fits into the workplace. It was discovered that EY's neurodivergent staff members excelled at innovation, coming up with improvements to training and automated procedures that neurotypical staff members missed. They subsequently produced instructional videos to show other company personnel how to use more effective automated processes. Due to its success, EY decided to establish a second Center of Excellence in Dallas in order to attract and develop more neurodiagnostic professionals in the state of Texas.
        I'll sum up by saying that AI has a big impact on accessibility, especially for neural acids. Access to education is increased thanks to AI-powered tools, which also assist neurodiverse students in better connecting language and objects. Artificial intelligence also expands neurodivergent people's employment options.</p>

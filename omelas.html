        Response Paper - Omelas
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas is a thought-provoking short story by Ursula K. Le Guin that challenges readers to consider the morality of sacrificing individual happiness for the greater good of the community. The story takes place in the fictional town of Omelas, where its inhabitants enjoy idyllic prosperity, joy and beauty. However, their happiness is built on the suffering of one child, locked in a basement and subjected to extreme abuse and neglect. The story follows the reactions of the various people of Omela when they hear about this victim and those who choose to leave their seemingly perfect society. <br>
       <strong>The main of the story is that sacrificing the happiness of one person for the happiness of many is not morally justified. Le Guin makes this argument through vivid imagery and powerful symbolism.
    </strong>  The city of Omelas is described in great detail, emphasizing its beauty, order and wealth. However, the image of the suffering child in the basement acts as a sharp contrast to the perfection of the city. The child represents the price of a community's happiness, and by revealing this sacrifice, Le Guin invites readers to question whether such a sacrifice is ever justified. <br>

        Another important thesis of the story is that individual conscience is necessary to make moral decisions. The characters in the story who decide to walk away from Omelas are those who refuse to accept the child's sacrifice as morally justified. When they are gone, they demonstrate their commitment to their moral values, even if it means giving up the interests of the society in which they live. Le Guin suggests that personal conscience is more important than social pressure and that people should not be afraid to question the morality of their actions or social norms. <br>
        Finally, the story suggests that the pursuit of happiness should not come at the expense of others. The people of Omela enjoy their happiness regardless of the child's suffering. In doing so, they reveal an egoism that is antithetical to any true concept of happiness. Le Guin suggests that true happiness can only be achieved by sharing, not by relying on the suffering of others. <br>
        In conclusion, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas is a powerful story that makes readers question whether it is moral to sacrifice individual happiness for the greater good of the community. The story emphasizes the importance of individual conscience, the dangers of egoism, and the need for a common concept of happiness independent of the suffering of others. Le Guin's story is a reminder that true happiness is only possible if it is based on justice and compassion for all.
